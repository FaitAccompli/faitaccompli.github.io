Welcome to my blog! I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Electronics Engineering, currently working in AI-assisted medical image analysis. My journey into Quantum Oncology began with a personal connection to cancer, as my family has a history of lymphoma. 

As I explored the fascinating world of quantum computing, I realized its potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and diagnostics. This blog documents my learning journey as I dive into quantum mechanics and its applications in Oncology.

Join me as I tackle complex concepts, share insights, and explore how technology can make a difference in the fight against cancer. 

Stay tuned for updates and feel free to reach out if you share similar interests! 

**P.S.** I might not have all the answers, but I promise to make it entertaining, maybe not quantum-entangled entertaining, but entertaining nonetheless!
